We want to build a [Cosmology](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-wallet)-like starter dApp but for Dart / Flutter, for **trustless mobile-friendly peer-to-peer operation in the field**. The project has emerged from the need to allow for field inspectors of the decentralized power grid infrastructure to have **Android, iOS,** or at substations - **Windows / Mac / Linux** apps w/ WalletConnect support + QR code driven workflows, with minimum code modification.

0. a `birb` is a decentralized, censorship-resistant cross-platform interchain dApp that consists of a combination of `Dart / Flutter` and `FFI Rust` components (and wrapped `JS` if we absolutely have to)

1. the milestone to hit and cause behind HackJuno application is a `CosmWasm` contract interaction with the message, two approaches now are:

**Dart** - implementing `sign` etc. for WalletConnect similar to how Algorand did it: https://github.com/RootSoft/walletconnect-dart-sdk/pull/71

**cosmrs** - Rust client https://docs.rs/cosmrs/latest/cosmrs/
https://github.com/PeggyJV/ocular

**CosmJS wrapper** - similar to https://github.com/y-pakorn/flutter_web3,  one can wrap the following:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs
... and then gradually oxidize ðŸ¦€ / add libp2p functionality for swarm operation in hostile environments https://docs.rs/libp2p-swarm/latest/libp2p_swarm/ (e.g. trustless peer discovery)
